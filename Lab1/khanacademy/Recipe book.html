        <p class="pasta"><strong>Step 1:</strong> In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook the spaghetti until just al dente. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water.
</p>
<p class="pasta"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk the egg yolks and cream. In a large, deep skillet, heat the oil. Add the pancetta and cook over moderately high heat, stirring, until crisp, 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until golden, 1 minute.
</p>
<p class="pasta"><strong>Step 3:</strong>Add the spaghetti to the skillet. Cook over low heat, tossing, until coated. Slowly add the reserved pasta cooking water and beaten egg yolks. Toss until coated with a creamy sauce, about 1 minute. Add the 1 cup of Parmesan and the nutmeg; season with pepper. Transfer to bowls and serve, passing extra Parmesan.</p>

        <p class="pizza"><strong>Step 1:</strong> In a large bowl, mix the yeast with 1/2 cup of the warm water and the sugar. Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add the remaining 1 1/2 cups of warm water, flour, and kosher salt and stir until dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured work surface and knead, adding flour as necessary until a silky and soft dough forms. Use a pastry scraper to help knead the dough. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl and brush all over with olive oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight or for up to 3 days.
</p>
<p class="pizza"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface; punch down and divide into 4 pieces. Form each piece into a ball. Rub each ball with oil and transfer to a baking sheet. Cover the balls loosely with plastic wrap and let rise in a draft-free place for 1 hour.</p>
<p class="pizza"><strong>Step 3:</strong>Meanwhile, set a pizza stone in the oven and preheat the oven to 500Â°F, allowing at least 45 minutes for the stone to heat. Pass the tomatoes through a food mill set over a medium bowl or pulse them in a food processor until coarsely chopped. Stir in the oregano and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="pizza"><strong>Step 4:</strong>On a lightly floured surface, stretch one ball of dough into a 13-inch round; transfer to a floured pizza peel, adding flour where the dough sticks. Spread 1/4 cup of the tomato sauce over the dough to within 1 inch of the edge. Spread one-fourth of the cheese over the pizza and drizzle with 1 tablespoon of oil. Season with sea salt and pepper and slide the pizza onto the stone. Bake until the bottom is charred and the cheese is melted, about 8 minutes. Scatter one-fourth of the basil on top and let stand for 3 minutes before serving. Repeat with the remaining dough and toppings. </p>
